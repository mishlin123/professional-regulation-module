        presenter: "Rachel",
        explanation: "Some occupations like to call themselves 'professionals' (e.g., HR or librarians), but strictly speaking they are not part of a regulated profession. While they can be professional in their behavior, they have a membership organization and registration is not compulsory.",

The Code of Professional Responsibility applies even outside of school hours.",
        presenter: "Rachel",
        explanation: "How you dress and present yourself in school has an impact on your professionalism.

        title: "Professional Regulation",
        content: "## Why Are Teachers Regulated?\n\nRegulation exists to:\n\n1. **Protect the public**: Ensuring safety and quality for students and parents\n2. **Set standards**: Maintain the reputation of the teaching profession\n3. **Maintain public confidence**: Trust in the education system\n\nIn New Zealand, professions are largely 'self-regulated' - the main decision-making bodies (Professional Conduct Committees, Complaints Assessment Committees, Councils) are dominated by members of the profession itself.\n\n> Teachers are regulated under their own legislation and the **Code of Professional Responsibility**.",
        presenter: "Rachel",
        explanation: "Society wants people to be able to access services safely. We want children to go to school and learn, and we want people to trust that registered teachers will keep their children safe. Without this trust, societal structures would deteriorate.",

        title: "Tikanga: Whanaungatanga and Manaaki",
        content: "## Key Cultural Concepts\n\n### Whanaungatanga\nInvolves establishing a relationship of trust by making connections. This can include professionals sharing information about themselves - their whānau (family), whakapapa (ancestors), or personal life - to establish trust and relationship.\n\n**Important**: Understand what is appropriate to share. Very personal things like relationship issues would be going too far.\n\n### Manaaki\nInvolves sharing hospitality or kai (food) to show respect and establish relationships. It is important that professionals partake in rituals around food.\n\n> If you have Māori whānau, establishing relationships with the family may be just as important as working with the student. Involving them in decisions about the student's schooling will likely be very important.",
        presenter: "Rachel",
        explanation: "It is vital as a New Zealand professional to understand as much as you can about tikanga. If you are not sure what is appropriate to share with whānau, discuss this with your senior teacher or principal.",

It involves:\n- **Trust**\n- **Care**\n- **Authority**\n- **Influence**\n\n= An inherent **power imbalance** in all professional relationships\n\n### When is a Boundary Breached?\n\nWhen a professional **misuses the power imbalance** in the teacher-student relationship such that the student's safety or welfare is compromised.",
        presenter: "Rachel",
        explanation: "At all times, it is the professional's responsibility to establish and maintain the boundary. You cannot expect students to maintain boundaries - that responsibility lies with you as the adult and the professional.",

Emotional Breach\n- Giving preferential treatment to a student\n- Having a 'favourite' student and spending more time with them\n- Rewarding or punishing students inconsistently\n\n### 2. Financial Breach\n- Giving a student money or gifts\n- Accepting gifts from students or parents\n\n### 3. Communication Breach\n- Over-sharing personal matters\n- Asking students about personal matters beyond the teacher-student relationship\n- Discussing inappropriate topics\n\n### 4. Sexual / Relationship Breach\n- Engaging in an intimate or sexual relationship\n- Expressing romantic feelings\n- Flirtatious behavior\n\n### 5. Grooming (Criminal Offence)\n- Deliberate, calculated, manipulative acts\n- Goal: create emotional dependency to gain trust before starting a sexual relationship",
        presenter: "Bindy",
        explanation: "It is human nature to like some people more than others. The key is to notice when this happens. While you can be friendly towards students, it is not your role to be their friend. Being a professional means sometimes putting on your 'game face' - it's not about you, it's about them.",

        content: "## A Crucial Distinction\n\n> While you can be **friendly** towards students, it is **not your role to be their friend**.\n\nBeing a professional means that sometimes you need to put on your 'game face' and not show exactly what is going on for you.\n\n**Why?**\n- It is not about you, it's about them\n- While your needs are important, the needs of your students are most important\n- It is fantastic that you care, but you **cannot over-care and over-share**\n- This is when things get very risky for professionals\n\n**You are there to be a TEACHER.**",

A series of professional boundary breaches, which individually may not have resulted in professional discipline, cumulatively amounted to serious misconduct.\n\n## The Incidents\n\nIn a Year 12 class, Mr Fisher:\n- Used a sexualized hand gesture mimicking sexual intercourse\n- Swore (using words like 'fuck' and 'little bitch')\n- Discussed topics such as sex and drug use\n- Showed students a photo on his phone of a cannabis plant\n- Was overly familiar with students\n\n## The Defence\n\nHis lawyer argued the over-familiarity was \"symptomatic of a person desperate to establish a good atmosphere in the classroom in the hope that it would assist with his teaching.\" It was done without ulterior motives.",

This is not saying one-offs will be excused, but this teacher exercised poor professional judgment over and over again.",

        presenter: "Bindy",
        explanation: "When you have a vulnerable person - and younger people, teenagers are by definition very vulnerable because of their age - a boundary breach has much more of an impact. The professional knows more about the student than the student knows about the teacher. It is the professional, therefore, that has all of the power from the very start.",

Am I showing favoritism?\n\n- Am I doing something for them that **they could do themselves**? (Fostering dependency?) Or am I being harsher on them than others?\n\n- Am I **frequently thinking** of that student when I am away from work?\n\n- Is my **dress, language, availability, or demeanor different** when I am with a particular student?\n\n- Am I sharing information with or helping this student because **I need to be liked** or be seen as 'special' or 'helpful'?\n\n- Do I really need to **respond to that text message** right now? At all?\n\n- Is it possible that my behavior could **adversely affect the wellbeing** of a student?\n\n- **Whose needs** are being met if I do this particular activity?\n\n- Would I **judge another teacher negatively** if I saw them doing what I am doing?\n\n- How would I **explain my actions** to my Principal, the Board of Trustees, my partner, the Teaching Council?",

But what do you do if you have **concerns about how a colleague is behaving**?\n\nFor example:\n- A colleague showing too much attention to a student\n- Someone appearing too close to a student\n- Inappropriate conversations or behavior\n\n### Key Principle\n\n**Tolerance of the behavior by other people is NOT relevant.**\n\nIf others think what your colleague is doing is acceptable but **you** think they are crossing a professional boundary, **you need to act**.\n\n**It is your professional duty.**",

Get advice. Ask for help.\n\n### If Nothing Happens\n\n**What do you do if your manager does nothing or downplays it?**\n\n1. **Email them** to confirm your conversation and ask for a reply\n2. If it's still going on, **go up the chain**: DP → Principal → Board of Trustees\n3. If it's very serious, contact the professional regulator: **Teaching Council**\n\n### If You Remain Concerned\n\n**Keep on it.** It is your professional duty to protect students from harm.",
